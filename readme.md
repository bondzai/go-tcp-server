## TCP Echo Server

This repository contains a simple TCP echo server implemented in Go. The server listens on a specified address and port, accepts incoming TCP connections, and echoes back any data it receives from clients.

## Features
- Echo Functionality: The server echoes back any data it receives from connected clients.

- Graceful Shutdown: The server handles interrupt signals (Ctrl+C or SIGTERM) gracefully, ensuring that it closes existing connections and shuts down cleanly.

## Usage
Connect to the server using a TCP client, such as Telnet or netcat, to interact with the echo functionality. For example, using Telnet:

```bash
telnet 127.0.0.1 8080
```

Once connected, type any message, and the server will echo it back.

## Best Practices
1. Concurrency: The server handles multiple concurrent connections using goroutines, making it scalable and efficient.

2. Error Handling: Robust error handling is implemented to identify and log any issues that may arise during the server's operation.

3. Signal Handling: Graceful shutdown is achieved by handling interrupt signals, ensuring that the server cleans up resources before exiting.

4. Readability: The code is well-organized, with clear comments and function names, promoting readability and maintainability.

5. Logging: Informative log messages are used to provide insights into the server's activities, making it easier to troubleshoot issues.

6. Configuration: Server address and port are configurable, allowing users to easily customize the deployment.
